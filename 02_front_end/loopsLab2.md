## Loops Lab 2

1.  Write a for loop that will iterate from 50 to 20.
For each iteration, if the current number is a multiple of 3, console.log the value.


2.  Write out an "infinite loop" below. Don't run the loop in your console unless you are prepared to force quit your browser!!

3.  Loop through this array and print every other value, starting with the first.

```javascript
var classmates = ["Bridjet", "Nathan", "Matias", "Mike", "Jason", "Reuben", "Ben", "Lane", "John", "Chris", "Terry", "Ann", "Katelyn", "Naomi", "Jeff"];
```

4.  Create a new array with the gluten-free options from this menu:

```javascript
var menu = [{name: "pizza", glutenFree: false},{name: "salad", glutenFree: true},{name: "donut", glutenFree: false},{name: "steak", glutenFree: true},{name: "chicken", glutenFree: true},{name: "cheeseburger", glutenFree: false}];
```

### Bonus Question(hard mode)
Create a new array with all the players that have a true value of goat (greatest of all time) from each league.

```javascript
var league = [{name: "NFL", players: [{name: "Tom Brady", goat: false}, {name: "Walter Payton", goat: true}]}, {name: "NBA", players: [{name: "Michael Jordan", goat: true}, {name: "Lebron James", goat: false}]},{name: "MLB", players: [{name: "Babe Ruth", goat: true}, {name: "Alex Rodriguez", goat: false}]}]
```
