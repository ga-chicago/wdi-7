## Function Practice



1. Write a JavaScript function that will find the largest of five numbers. Display an alert box to show the result. 
Sample numbers : -5, -2, -6, 0, -1 
Output : 0 

2.  Write a JavaScript conditional statement to sort three numbers. Display an alert box to show the result. 
Sample numbers : 0, -1, 4 
Output : 4, 0, -1 

3. Write a JavaScript function to get the first element of an array. Passing a parameter 'n' will return the first 'n' elements of the array. 
Test Data : 
```
console.log(first([7, 9, 0, -2])); 
console.log(first([],3));
console.log(first([7, 9, 0, -2],3));
console.log(first([7, 9, 0, -2],6));
console.log(first([7, 9, 0, -2],-3));
```
Expected Output : 
```
7
[] 
[7, 9, 0] 
[7, 9, 0, -2] 
```

4. Write a simple JavaScript program to join all elements of the following array into a string. 
Sample array : ```myColor = ["Red", "Green", "White", "Black"];```
Expected Output : 
```"Red,Green,White,Black"```

5.  Write a JavaScript program which accept a number as input and insert dashes (-) between each two even numbers. For example if you accept 025468 the output should be 0-254-6-8.

6. Write a JavaScript program to find the most frequent item of an array. 
Sample array : ```var arr1=[3, 'a', 'a', 'a', 2, 3, 'a', 3, 'a', 2, 4, 9, 3];```
Sample Output : a ( 5 times )
