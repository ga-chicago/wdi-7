##Loop Js

### use a for loop to solve the following problems

1.  Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20.
For each iteration, it will check if the current
number is even or odd,
and `console.log` the result (e.g. "2 is even").

2.  Define a variable named myBagOfBeans and set it equal to fifty.
loop down from a hundred and if the number is even add the current value to myBagOfBeans.

3.  Loop through this array, and seperate the drinks, the food, and the sauces into seperate arrays. 

`var arrayOfStringsRememberIcanNameMyVariablesAnythingIWant =
    ['cheese', 'pepperoni', 'sausage', 'coca cola', 'lemonade', 'dough', 'beer', 'wine', 'ranch', 'blue cheese', 'bbq sauce'];`

4.  Loop through the following array and push the items that are not numbers 
into a seperate array

`var mixedArray = [1, 2, 3, 'taco', 4, 5, 6, 'burrito', 7, 8, 9, 'Whats the deal with airplane peanuts', 3.14, {barry: "Mannilow",}, 6, 55, null, "Old " + "Crow " + " Medicine Show", 3, 2, "I want the calzone from pizanos", "Death blow", "Firestorm", "48", 30]`

5.  Loop through the following array and push the items that make up a cheese burger, 
or spaghetti into a seperate array name dinner.

`var food = ['bun', "jalepeno cheddar", "elk", "beef", "1954 ford mustang", 1.14, 1.23, 'hot dog', "gary clark jr",  " I'lll never fall in love again", "mustard", "ketchup", 30, 50, 80, "grilled onions", "egg", "Dr. Suess"]`

### Use a `for in` loop to loop through the following objects and print to the console,
the name of each property.

6.  `var colorObjects = {red: 'red', blue: 'blue', cyan: 'cyan'}`

7.  `var seinfeld    = {cosmo: "kramer", jerry: "Seinfeld", george: "constanza", elaine: "bennis"}`

8.  `var profile       = {name: "Elon Musk", occupation: "space man", hobbies: ["paypal", "space X", "rocket science"]}`



### Use a `for loop` or a `for in` loop and print out the properties of the object or value of the indexin the array,  Above your code write in a comment what loop you are using and why


9.  `var oldTime = ["benton flippen", "carter family", "roscoe Holcomb", "gus cannon", "Tommy Jarrell"];`

10. `var sandwhich = {name: "sunday morning special", bread: "ciabatta", cheese: "pepper jack", green: "arugala", redStuff: "cherry tomatoes", heated: true}`
