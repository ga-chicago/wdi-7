1.  Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 10. For each iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the number by 9 and log the result (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").
Bonus: Use a nested for loop to show the tables for every multiplier from 1 to 10 (100 results total).

2.  Write a function named assignGrade that:
takes 1 argument, a number score(examle: 89 returns B).
returns a grade for the score, either "A", "B", "C", "D", or "F".
Call that function for a few different scores and log the result to make sure it works.

3.  Check the results of assignGrade function from the previous exercise for every value from 60 to 100 - so your log should show "For 89, you got a B. For 90, you got an A.", etc. 

4. Write a function named `tellFortune` that:

- Takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
- Tutputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
- Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.

5. Write a JavaScript function which will take an array of numbers stored and find the second lowest and second greatest numbers, respectively. 
Sample array : [1,2,3,4,5]
Expected Output : 2,4 

6. Write a JavaScript function that accepts two arguments, a string and a letter and the function will count the number of occurrences of the specified letter within the string. 
Sample arguments : 'Listen to the river sing sweet songs, 'o' 
Expected output : 1 

7.  Write a JavaScript function that accept a list of country names as input and returns the longest country name as output. Go to the editor 
Sample function : LongestCountryName(["Australia", "Germany", "United States of America"])
Expected output : "United States of America"
