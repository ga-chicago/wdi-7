## Required Reading

The WDI class has required reading for homework on occasion. These are from freely available and legal sources.

* [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) by Marijn Haverbeke (Creative Commons)
* [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/) by Shaye Howe
* [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/) by Zed Shaw

## Highly Suggested Reading When you are ready for it 

We highly recommend reading Sandi Metz's **Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby** when we begin covering Ruby in class. This is a paid book but it is (in our opinion) a vital read for this cohort.
